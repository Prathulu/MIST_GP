## Problem Description:
The given task is to model and build a relational database that stores useful and necessary information for the manager of a football club. The main entities in the model are the Players and Teams entities. "Players" refers to each of the individuals that participate in games and "Teams" refers to the grouping of specific players together. For each player, there is a record of their contract, game statistics, medical history, and brand deals. Moreover, all teams have distinct sponsorships, coaches, practices, games, etc. Our goal is to effectively and efficiently model these various relationships, create sample data, and use said data to populate all of the entities and their attributes. Additionally, we need to construct functioning queries on this data in order for us to obtain valuable insight about how the club operates 
in a manner that is relevant from a managerial perspective.
